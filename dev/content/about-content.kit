            i grew up in Hanoi, Vietnam, and went to Drexel University to pursue a bachelor of science in graphic design with a minor in user experience & interaction design.

            i’m a curious designer, which means i’m always eager to learn and challenge myself with different medium and methods.
            i love working on, but not limited to, <span class="about-bold">brand identity, publication, packaging</span> and <span class="about-bold">web design</span>. 
        </p>
        <p class="about-bodycopy">
            i have a weird obsession with ancient things. i love film photos, hand-drawn frame-by-frame animations, retro designs, and my old Hanoi. 
            when not designing, you can find me drawing \ sketching with (mostly) Korean dramas running in the background :)
