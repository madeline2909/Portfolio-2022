            <p>Vietnam is a country with more than 20,000 years of history and traditions, but not every tradition survived and is preserved until this day. Each time a new dynasty started, people had to change the way they dress. After a long time, history got lost and most of those past garments became foreign to people, even to the Vietnamese themselves. This virtual exhibition is created with the hope of bringing back the lost history, encouraging the interest in Vietnam’s rich culture, and supporting the ancient costume revival movement that’s emerging in Vietnam in recent years.</p>
